* About
This BuildRoot repo is based on instructions from the Olimex [[https://www.olimex.com/wiki/Build_Bootable_SD_Card_with_Debian][wiki]].

It is for my personal use.

* Instructions
Try this command to achive it:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
 make a13_olinuxino_defconfig
 make
#+END_SRC

At the end of the compilation process you will see instructions to create sd image.

Please, if you find it useful try to use or build it.

* Why it may be useful for you
This is original buildroot besides that, it contains:
 - script to make sd card image
 - package to build OLIMEX UEXT modules for A13-OLinuXino
 - other new packages (picolisp)
